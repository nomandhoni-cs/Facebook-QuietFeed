# Facebook-QuietFeed Extension

## Overview

Facebook-QuietFeed is a browser extension designed to enhance your Facebook browsing experience by hiding suggested posts in your feed. Our goal is to provide you with a cleaner and more focused environment while using Facebook, minimizing distractions and allowing you to engage with content that matters to you.

## Features

- **Hide Suggested Posts:** Facebook-QuietFeed automatically hides the "Suggested for You" posts in your Facebook feed, reducing clutter and allowing you to concentrate on posts from your friends and pages you follow.

- **Future Feature: Hide Facebook Reels (Coming Soon):** We are actively working on adding the ability to hide Facebook Reels, further reducing unwanted distractions and enhancing your browsing experience.
